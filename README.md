# Kneehealth-Platform: Smart Post-TKA Rehabilitation Monitoring System

## 📌 Overview

Every year in China, over **one million Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)** procedures are performed for patients suffering from mid-to-late-stage osteoarthritis. Following surgery, patients typically need to return to hospitals multiple times over a six-month rehabilitation period—an especially heavy burden for those with limited mobility.

**kneehealth-platform** offers an innovative solution to this challenge by enabling **remote monitoring of post-TKA rehabilitation progress**. Through a specially designed **smart wearable knee sensor** and a **HarmonyOS-based mobile application**, patients and doctors can seamlessly stay connected throughout the recovery process.
